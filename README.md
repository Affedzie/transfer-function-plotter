# Transfer Function Plotter

Python script for step response & Bode plot analysis of transfer functions.

## Control System Analysis and Visualization

This Python script allows users to analyze and visualize the step response or Bode plot of a transfer function under different time constants and orders of approximation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have installed the required libraries: control, matplotlib, numpy (use `conda install control matplotlib numpy`).
3. Run the `transfer-function-plotter` script using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the prompts to input the transfer function coefficients, time constants, and orders of approximation.
5. Choose between a Step Response Graph or a Bode Plot.
6. The script will generate the corresponding plots for each combination of time constants and orders of approximation.
